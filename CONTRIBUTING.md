# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve `opencode-agentspawn`.

## What’s in scope
We’re optimizing for **agent reliability, collaboration, and safety**. High-value contributions include:
- Better workspace patterns (doc hygiene, boot ordering, reuse-first/verify-first)
- Better example prompts (domain-agnostic; no real credentials)
- OpenCode config snippets (primary vs subagent workflows)
- Optional GitHub Actions for secret scanning (must be safe-by-default)
- Improvements to docs clarity

## What’s out of scope
- Anything that requires sharing real secrets or account identifiers
- Provider-specific hacks or anything ToS-adjacent

## Style guidelines
- Keep templates minimal and copy/pasteable
- Prefer short, actionable docs over theory
- Avoid hardcoding personal paths, emails, IDs

## Submitting changes
1) Fork / use a branch
2) Make changes
3) Open a PR with:
   - what problem it solves
   - why it’s safe
   - examples (before/after)
