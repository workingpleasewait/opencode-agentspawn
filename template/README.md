# Template workspace (copy into your new agent repo)

This folder is meant to be copied into a new repository.

## Rename placeholders
- `agents/your_agent/` → `agents/<your_agent_name>/`
- `docs/topic/` → `docs/<your_topic>/`

Then customize:
- `agents/<your_agent_name>/AGENTS.md`
- `agents/<your_agent_name>/DOMAIN_CONTEXT.md`
- `USER.md`
- `KNOWLEDGE.md`

Keep `journal/` short; put deep work into `docs/<topic>/log/`.
